# Current Format: [TIME USER@HOST PWD] >
# TIME:
#    Green     == machine load is low
#    Orange    == machine load is medium
#    Red       == machine load is high
#    ALERT     == machine load is very high
# USER:
#    Cyan      == normal user
#    Orange    == SU to user
#    Red       == root
# HOST:
#    Cyan      == local session
#    Green     == secured remote connection (via ssh)
#    Red       == unsecured remote connection
# PWD:
#    Green     == more than 10% free disk space
#    Orange    == less than 10% free disk space
#    ALERT     == less than 5% free disk space
#    Red       == current user does not have write privileges

# >:
#    White     == no background or suspended jobs in this shell
#    Cyan      == at least one background job in this shell

#    runners are healthy
#    Command is added to the history file each time you hit enter,
#    so it's available to all shells (using 'history -a').

else
